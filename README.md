# HydraGame

Implementation of the Hydra Game described in the paper
_Accessible independence results for Peano Arithmetic_
by L. Kirby and J. Paris. A good explanation of the rules can be found
[here](https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/06/hydra-game-an-example-of-a-counterintuitive-mathematical-result.html).

## How to use

Use arrow keys to move the selected node, keys `j,i,l,k` to translate
the drawing, scroll to zoom in or out, and `Enter` to chop off
one of the Hydra's heads (the node in selection).
